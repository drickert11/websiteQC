			How does a Quantum Computer logically work and how is it’s software run differently than that of our modern computers? 
			In order to understand this, it’s important to first look at the science behind  the computer. “Classical mechanics refers 
			to the classical physics of bodies and forces, especially Newton's laws of motion and the principles of mechanics based on them”<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/classical-physics">(dictionary.com, 2018)</a>. 
			According to the textbook, Physics for scientists & engineers with modern physics, lassical physics has always been good at finding approximations when it comes to the study of objects in motion in terms of force and energy. 
			Our modern day computer’s bit logic and decision making is based on classical mechanics. The issue with this is therories within the laws of classical
			mechanics breakdown when applied to frames of reference dealing with the speed of light or frames that of infintesimally small like dealing with atoms. 
			Thus calculations performed through classical mechanics of such don’t work too well. Since calculations fail, simulations fail, and our modern day computers 
			are limited to a classical style of thinking which is why they are reffered to as classical computers. 
			<br><br>
			In the early 20th century, we saw the birth and development of Modern Physics. This area of physics can be broken down into 2 major sections. First being the 
			Theory of Relaitivity and Second which is what we’ll be focusing on is the Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Mechanics is “a theory of the mechanics of atoms, molecules, 
			and other physical systems that are subject to the uncertainty principle” <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/quantum-mechanics">(dictionary.com, 2018)</a>. Quantum Computers base their logic on those principles. How this 
			works is through the manipulation of the bit versus the manipulation of the qubit (bit of a quantum computer). A bit can be broken down to a 1 or a 0 and these bits 
			perform instructions and calculations to produce anything from any of our current classical computers. The qubit on the other hand can exist in the state of a 1, 0, 
			or both. A superposition is where states exist with each other as 1 <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.1509&rep=rep1&type=pdf">(Hayward, 2005)</a>. To put it in perspective, a number of N qubits can exist in a superposition of 
			all 2^N of its distinct logical states, whereas N bits can exist in N states <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_97/journal/vol4/spb3">(Bone and Castro, 1997)</a>. Because of this Quantum computers can perform some types of 
			calculations exponentially quicker and can even explore multiple answers at once. Take our current encryption as an example, modern encryption lies in the area where 
			classical computers mathematically fail. This is why encryption will often use extremely large numbers to encrypt as classical computers are unable to factor in a 
			reasonable time, as it can’t check all the possibilities, as that would take years. Quantum computers utilizing shor’s algorithm can cut that time down to mere 
			minutes<a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience">(IBMQ, 2017)</a>.
			<br><br>
			At this stage, software built for quantum computers is not near at the level of classical computers. Quantum computers may never replace classical computers, as 
			they are on their own extremely powerful. What we may see instead is a hybrid where software runs through the classical or quantum depending on what it needs. As 
			of right now you can access a little bit of what is out there, IBM Q has a quantum composer you can run tests and simulations with a few 
			qubits<a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience">(IBMQ, 2017)</a>. Nothing near java, but it is quantum software to say the least. Microsoft has a quantum language, Q#, is built 
			with the a hybrid prediction functionality where the quantum computer is built in as a coprocessor much like a GPU, or FPGA would be. However at this point it is 
			still only simulated<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/language/?view=qsharp-preview">(Microsoft, 2017)</a>.
