		<h3>1980</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
				Paul Benioff proposed the idea of the Quantum Turing Machine or Quantum Computer. Unlike the
				classical computuer which functioned on the classical mechanical principle, this one functioned
				on the quantum mechanical principle.</p>

		<h3>1982</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
				Richard Feynman published a paper named <em>Simulating physics with computers</em> where he proved that quatum systems found in physics
				cannot be simulated with classical computers.

				Richard Feynman, in his lecture, showed a Quantum Computer would be able to simulate any quantum system.
				Including one that would simulate the quantum properties of the physical world.

		<h3>1985</h3>
			<div>
				<p><!--context-->
				The physicist, David Deustch, put in context the idea of the world's first Universal Quantum Computer.
				Not only did he show how a quantum computer could reproduce in realizable physical system, but he also
				showed how a quantum computer could perform certain types of calculations exponentially fast than classical
				computers. He was the first conceptually explain the Quantum Turing Machine.

		<h3>1994</h3>
			<div>
				<p><!--context-->
				Peter Shor came up with a Quantum Algorithm that could calculate prime numbers at exponentially faster rate than classical
				computers. As modern encryptions rely on the fact that classical computers can't factor large prime numbers well this meant that
				with enough computing power Shor's algorithm could be used to break encryptions.
