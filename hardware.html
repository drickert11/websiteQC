			There have been plenty of different setups for the building of a quantum computer. Unfortunately, in todays time there is still no universal quantum computer. 
			That being said there have been some great strides. As the turing machine is the idea behind the classical computer, a quantum turing machine is the idea 
			behind a quantum computer. In a classical turing machine there is a tape in which a cpu reads and writes to and from the tape, in which the tape is divided
			into squares. Depending on the instruction given by the tape which are a defined 1 or 0 in each square. Given an infinite amount of time it can do anything 
			you see on your classical computer screen. The hardware in your computers are built off that foundation. A quantum turing machine the tape, and the head exist 
			in quantum states and the tape can hold a value of 1, 0, or both through superposition. Unlike a classical turing machine where everything is defined and things
			happen 1 at a time essentially, the quatum turing machine can have simulataneous inputs and perform all its calculations to each of the inputs at the same time

			Google has only recently gotten committed to quantum computers however has been keep close to the lead as far as the race to a universal quantum computer. 
			They uses what they call super conducting qubits. In a conventional DRAM circuit, a logical state is determined by around 300,000 electrons, instead of 1. 
			Since electrons are so small and constantly bouncing around, electrons are leaked. The DRAM will check for leaks and actually replenish if they detect missing
			electrons. Qubits needs to take a whole different approach. In order to be in a superposition without reducing to 1 or 0 the electrons need to be unobserved by
			anything in the universe. If even a photon where to interact with it, it could carry off quantum information with it as if it was observed. When a superposition 
			collapses into a 1, or 0, it is known as decoherence
			<a href="https://hackernoon.com/decoherence-quantum-computers-greatest-obstacle-67c74ae962b6">(Bassan, 2018)</a>. 
			This has been the  biggest issue in quantum computing. So what is their solution to deal with all the “noise” that would cause decoherence? Some metals when cooled to a near 0
			degress kelvin, electrons unify together as one single unit, no longer bouncing around. The leaks and quantum errors are said to be at a rate of near 0. With
			that they are able to perform what they need. However, it is still not a perfect system. You can view more of their explaination here:
